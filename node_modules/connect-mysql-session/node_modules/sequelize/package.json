  "readme": "# Sequelize #\n\nThe Sequelize library provides easy access to a MySQL database by mapping database entries to objects and vice versa. To put it in a nutshell... it's an ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper). The library is written entirely in JavaScript and can be used in the Node.JS environment.\n\n## Features ##\n\n- Schema definition\n- Schema synchronization/dropping\n- Easy definition of class/instance methods\n- Instance saving/updating/dropping\n- Asynchronous library\n- Associations\n- Importing definitions from single files\n\n## Documentation, Examples and Updates ##\n\nYou can find the documentation and announcements of updates on the [project's website](http://www.sequelizejs.com).  \nIf you want to know about latest development and releases, follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/sdepold).  \nAlso make sure to take a look at the examples in the repository. The website will contain them soon, as well. For a (more or less) complete overview of changes in 1.0.0. take a look at [this blogpost](http://blog.depold.com/post/5936116582/changes-in-sequelize-1-0-0).\n\n## Collaboration ##\n\nI'm glad to get pull request if any functionality is missing or something is buggy. But _please_ ... run the tests before you send me the pull request.\n\n## Tests ##\n\nIn order to run the tests, you need the expresso framework! When installed just run:\n\n    expresso -s test/**/*",
